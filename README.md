This notebook contains the process of data analysis and creation of a classification algorithm to tackle the task of predicting hotel cancellations. An initial analysis is conducted on the dataset, which aims to explore the kind of data we've been provided; said analysis is refined by the use of inferential statistics (e.g., hypothesis testing) to draw conclusions from the information that's been gathered. Finally, an appropriate machine learning model is applied to solve the task.
